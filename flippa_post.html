          <p><em>An ongoing study by Garrett Chestnut, undergraduate CS student at Stevens Institute of Technology.</em></p>
          <p><em><strong>Commenced:</strong></em> June 8th, 2020  /  <em><strong>Last Updated:</strong></em> June 21th, 2020</p>
          <hr>
          <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
          <p>For the past few years, I have been an active member of the Flippa online community, building and selling many different assets (primarily android applications). During that time I have developed a hypothesis relating to the diversity of asset valuations within sub-industries (e.g., e-commerce websites, domain names, Amazon FBA, etc). By observing auctions unfold, I noticed that bidders cared very little about the content behind each property (i.e., subject-matter, topic, niche) and based most, if not all, of their appraisal on metrics. By “metrics”, I mean traffic, downloads, uniques, profit, age, and other important features.</p>
          <p>However, this isn’t surprising. Most of the goods on Flippa sell for less than $5000, making them less significant than the ones sold on sites like Exchange Marketplace, which have a much higher average value. Due to this reality, buyers are less interested in holding onto profitable assets for the long-term, which would require a strong or steadily growing niche, and more concerned in a quick ROI. </p>
          <p>A relatively low-risk method of obtaining an efficient ROI is to invest in assets that are already proving themselves within key metrics. In this study, I have decided to utilize elementary and intermediate machine learning models to determine if asset features (obtained through Flippa’s public API) truly have a high degree of impact on the eventual auction sale price.</p>
          <p><em>*Note: This first portion of the study has been restricted to premium Flippa listings, since those are more likely to have equal visibility in the marketplace.</em></p>
          <hr>
          <h3 id="features">Features</h3>
          <p>The full list of the metrics I used to train my subsequent models is as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Downloads</li>
            <li>Average profit</li>
            <li>Buy-It-Now price</li>
            <li>Display price</li>
            <li>Listing duration</li>
            <li>Has verified revenue (yes/no)</li>
            <li>Has verified traffic (yes/no)</li>
            <li>Page views per month</li>
            <li>Profit per month</li>
            <li>Asset age</li>
            <li>Property type</li>
            <li>Uniques per month</li>
            <li>Industry</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Several of these features depend on the property type, so their values defaulted to zero if they weren’t applicable.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>My first attempt to develop a relationship between the aforementioned metrics and current price (the dependent variable), was with basic regression (Multiple and Polynomial). I used a dataset with 100 entries, reserving 20 of those for testing.</p>
          <p>A prediction was determined to be accurate if it fell within $100 of the true value, or deviated from it by no more than 5% (this definition is consistent throughout my research).</p>
          <h3 id="basic-regression-accuracy">Basic Regression Accuracy</h3>
          <table border="1">
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Multiple Linear Regression</td>
                <td>Polynomial Regression <i>(degree=3)</i></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>15%</td>
                <td>15%</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>Both Multiple Linear and Polynomial Regression managed to make the same number of good predictions, each accurately guessing a different set of 3 out of 20 sale prices. Of course, this is incredibly poor, and offers no significant support for my hypothesis. My next trial utilizes SVR (Support Vector Regression), a more advanced form of regression, in the hopes of establishing a more significant relationship.</p>

          <table border="1">
            <thead>
              <tr>
              <th><strong>Kernel</strong></th>
              <th><strong>Accuracy</strong></th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
              <td>Linear</td>
              <td>0%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <td>RBF (Radial Basis Function)</td>
              <td>20%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <td>Polynomial</td>
              <td>10%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
              <td>Sigmoid</td>
              <td>5%</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <p>Interestingly, the results from SVR were fairly on par with the basic regression techniques. RBF, the most popular Kernel used for SVR, performed the best out of the four, with 20% of its predictions considered close. Below is a graph that displays the prediction results from the RBF kernel alongside the testing values.</p>
